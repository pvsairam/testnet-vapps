## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: SoundAds
- **Category**: social + infrastructure

### Description
SoundAds is a decentralized advertising platform where communities, projects, and individuals can buy pixel-based ad slots on a shared 4K canvas. Each ad is recorded immutably, payments are verified across chains, and ad placements are censorship-resistant.
The vApp solves the trust gap in Web3 advertising: today, most ads rely on centralized platforms, which lack transparency, can censor content, and do not provide verifiable proof of ownership. SoundAds ensures ads are provable, tamper-proof, and permanently verifiable on-chain.

### SL Integration  
Soundness Layer (SL) will power the backbone of SoundAds by:

- Generating zk-proofs for ad ownership and placement validity.
- Providing cross-chain settlement guarantees, ensuring payments are verifiable and fraud-resistant.
- Enabling low-cost verification of ads while offloading heavy storage to WALRUS/IPFS.
- Using SLâ€™s censorship resistance and fast finality for a fair ad marketplace.

## Technical

### Architecture
- Frontend: Interactive pixel canvas (3840x2160) where users can browse, purchase, and verify ads.
- Smart Contracts (App Layer): Deployed on Ethereum or Base to manage ad slot ownership and payments, integrated with SL for verification.
- SL Proof Engine: Provides zk-proofs for ownership and cross-chain settlement.
- Storage Layer: Metadata and media files stored on WALRUS/IPFS with on-chain references.
- Backend: Orchestrates user sessions, payment flows, and off-chain indexing for fast retrieval.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Web3 libraries for wallet connection and data handling
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) with PostgreSQL for indexing and session management
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + Ethereum/Base
- **Storage**: WALRUS/IPFS for ad data and media

### Features
1. Proof-verified ad placements - every ad linked to zk-proofs on SL.
2. Multi-chain payments - ETH, Base, and more with settlement guarantees.
3. Permanent ad storage - censorship-resistant via WALRUS/IPFS.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Build basic ad board functionality with pixel-based placements
- [ ] Integrate Soundness Layer for proof-of-ownership validation
- [ ] Launch a simple UI for browsing and uploading ads

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Add full marketplace features (buy/sell slots)
- [ ] Implement Ethereum/Base payments with SL settlement guarantees
- [ ] Connect WALRUS/IPFS for decentralized ad storage
- [ ] Conduct user testing and refine for production readiness
  
## Innovation
SoundAds is unique because it brings verifiable trust to Web3 advertising. Every ad is backed by zk-proofs, recorded immutably, and resistant to censorship. Unlike centralized platforms, it gives communities and projects a transparent way to prove their promotions, while users can independently verify authenticity. This combination of transparency, decentralization, and proof-backed ownership makes it stand out as an advertising solution built for Web3.
